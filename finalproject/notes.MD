# Final Project Idea

I'm thinking of creating my own programming langauge that supports extremely basic functionality. Then, I fine-tune an LLM (language model) to generate programs in my language. I then use a search algorithm to find the program that best matches the input-output examples.

I need a lot of data to train the LLM on, so I could use a GAN to generate code written in my language. I don't need to fine tune on Q/A pairs. Rather, just fine-tuning on the raw code files themselves should suffice. 

Then, I'm thinking of trying to get the LLM to solve some basic coding exercises (write a factorial function, reverse a string, etc) and seeing how well it does.

I could first test the LLM pre-fine-tuned, post-fine-tuned, then post-fine-tuned with a search algorithm and compare the results


This issue is, this could be a substantial task and might not be reasonable to do within the scope of a few weeks. Maybe I could ask to do a group final project? I could ask Prof. Amin about this. Just wanted to jot down my intial thoughts for now.
